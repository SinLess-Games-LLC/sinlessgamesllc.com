      # NOTE: Here we are using the special `nx-cloud record` command to ensure that any commands we run that do not go through the cloud task runner natively
      # (i.e. anything that starts with `nx run`/`nx run-many`/`nx affected --target`), are still captured in the Nx Cloud UI and Github App comment for
      # easier troubleshooting. See more here: https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/set-up/record-commands#recording-non-nx-commands
